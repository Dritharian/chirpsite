## **SAN ANDREAS \
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES** \
Used and Edited with permission from initial writers


[TOC]



### GENERAL OVERVIEW

As Police we serve the community around us not only by oath but by moral compass, we are the face and body of law enforcement all across the state of San Andreas. The Los Santos Police Department and San Andreas State Police work hand in hand, side by side and body by body in all matters to the greater Public. \



##### Mission Statement

The San Andreas State Police are committed to protecting, preserving, and safeguarding the constitutional and civil rights of all citizens through impartial and courteous law enforcement with integrity and professionalism. We shall ensure public safety and provide quality service in partnership with our communities.


##### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>onor

Always act with the utmost integrity, and be honest and truthful. Enforce the laws equally and without bias. Hold yourself and other members to the highest ethical standards


##### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">D</span>uty

To protect and serve the public, prevent crime and apprehend offenders. Ensure the highest quality service to the public. Perform our duties honorably and accept the responsibility to carry them out. Our devotion to duty will never waiver.


### DEPARTMENT POLICIES


##### Community

It is compulsory that all officers within the department respect all members of the community without prejudice at all times.

Any and all forms of bullying, harassment and abuse is prohibited, and will be reported within the community as well as the department.

Breaching any of the community rules will be seen as a breach of department policy.


##### Department

The department reserves the right, at any time, to discipline an officer for any break of the department policies.

The department reserves the right to deny entry to any applicants should they fail to meet the expectations and requirements set. 

The Chain of Command is very clear, and must be followed and respected at all times.

Officers must obey the law whether they are on/off duty. Any person with a criminal record may be denied access to the department.

Officer progression takes place at the discretion of those responsible. These promotions should not be requested by an officer.

In the event of an internal affairs issue, officers will be expected to comply with any such investigations.


##### Public

All officers are expected to treat all civilians with respect, impartiality and a duty of care and protection.

Officers must have reasonable suspicion to stop and search, detain or arrest a person.

Any use of excessive force is strictly prohibited.

Officers shouldn’t abuse their powers to gain an advantage or better themselves.

Even off duty, officers will conduct themselves in a way that reflects their badge. Any reported misconduct toward civilians with malicious and/or unprofessional intent may be subject to disciplinary action.

 \



##### Public Masking and Officer Expectations 

In accordance with state law, all civilians must unmask when in government owned property. This extends to police stations, hospitals, and city hall.

All businesses have the right to make their own policies regarding masking. It is not the responsibility of the PD to get involved unless a business owner requests assistance regarding a masked individual. No action should be taken against the individual, unless there is further resistance when approached by an officer.

When performing a traffic stop, the officer has the right to ask the driver and any passengers in the vehicle to unmask. This is for the safety of the officer and any other government employee that may arrive on scene.


##### Traffic Stops

While typically simple, traffic stops should still be performed in a way that takes the safety of the officer and the safety of the public into consideration. Below are expectations regarding traffic stops:



* The officer should approach the vehicle in the safest way possible. An officer should not cross behind the stopped vehicle. If it is necessary for the officer to walk around a vehicle, it is best to cross behind the stopped police vehicle to add a layer of protection should the stopped vehicle back up.
* If the individual or any other individual inside the vehicle is masked, the officer should ask for masks to be removed for the safety of the officer. However, the officer cannot ask for the identification of anyone other than the driver, since they are getting the citation.
* When performing a stop on a vehicle in a BOLO, it is always best practice to call for additional units. This is for the safety of the officer.


##### Law Enforcement Premises Entry

All persons, (lawyers, suspects or otherwise) should be searched upon entering and exiting all law enforcement entities within the state of San Andreas. The only exceptions to this are government officials such as Law Enforcement Officers, Medical Personnel and any standing member of the DOJ (This does not include Public Defence Attorneys).


##### Vehicles

All officers will purchase their own vehicle for duty upon reaching the rank of officer. 


    This vehicle is not for personal use off-duty due to the nature of the vehicle. 


        No police vehicles will be stored outside of police department premises when out of service. Violation of this will result in disciplinary action.

There will be a general pool of vehicles kept within police department premises that are owned by the state. It is imperative that these vehicles are returned to the garage with the following: \
		Over ¾ tank of gas 


    Clean


    Fully maintained for the next driver

In the event that a government vehicle, inclusive of Emergency Medical Services is to be stolen all officers on duty must make an attempt to disable the vehicle, whether that is through Spike Strips, Pitting or shooting the tires/engine block of the vehicle but never at the individual unless the pose a threat to the public and or officers. No clearance is needed when a Government Vehicle is stolen, to carry out any of the above actions.


##### Radio

All officers are expected to have a radio on their person and to have that radio on at all times whilst on duty.

All officers should have clear and simple to the point communications, this is to reduce the delay in responding officers and for getting information across when in dire situations. \
	Communications are to be sorted by Priority, this is so important information is conveyed and all officers are on the same page. This means Robberies, active pursuits and shootings take priority over Traffic Stops or lesser procedures.


##### Attendance

All calls are limited to 2 Units (Cars) per call, with the exception of the following:



* Shop Robberies (3 UNITS) - 1 Unit to stay back and gather evidence/Look after a Hostage.
* Fleeca Bank Robberies (4 UNITS) - 1 Unit to stay back and gather evidence/Look after a Hostage. Air 1 can be one of these units. Should additional support be needed for pursuit, a 5th unit can be called in, but the unit gathering evidence/looking after the hostage MUST return to PD or respond to other calls.
* Active **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dangerous</span>** Pursuits (3 UNITS) - Any Pursuit that endanger the lives of Officers and members of the public. If your suspect is running over sidewalks or actively putting others in peril to a point that is destructive, the safety of officers and the public comes before the arrest of the suspect and pursuing units are required to judge when the chase should end.
* Pacific Standard, Paleto Bank, Maze Bank, and assorted heists (5 UNITS) - 1 Unit to stay back and gather evidence/Look after a Hostage. Air 1 can be one of these units. Should additional support be needed for pursuit, a 6th unit can be called in, but the unit gathering evidence/looking after the hostage MUST return to PD or respond to other calls.
* In the event that a government employee, such as an officer or a member of San Andreas Medical is attacked or downed, an **All Call** may be put out. This is a mobilization of all available units to the aid of the government employee. Units are cautioned that this may leave areas of the state completely exposed and it is necessary that the first unit on scene update all available units to allow units to go back to their usual patrols.


##### Pursuits

All officers are to Maintain a 2 Vehicle Length distance between themselves, a fleeing suspect and fellow pursuing officers while in a high speed pursuit. The Secondary Unit is to maintain communications if the Primary vehicle is single manned. Otherwise the passenger of the primary unit is to take over communications throughout the chase and is not to be cut off.

Officer discretion is advised while in a chase as they are usually situational, when a chase becomes too reckless, judged by;



* Endangering the Public.
* Endangering their own lives.

Then a supervising officer, the rank of a Sergeant or above can authorize one of the following actions to put a halt to the pursuit;



* PIT Maneuver - The idea of using the front of a Police vehicle, to make contact with either the left or right rear side of the suspect vehicle to ensure they spin out and come to a stop.
* A Box Maneuver - The idea of 4 police units surrounding the suspect vehicle, in a box formation to slow down and put an end to the pursuit.
* Spike Strips - The use of 2 sets of spike Strips that come mandatory in each Police vehicle, to deflate the tires on the vehicle once at a safe speed to eventually have the vehicle come to a stop.

HSPU Vehicles are to take Primary in pursuits unless commanded by Lt.+ to do otherwise, while any unit is in Primary, they are not to be over taken unless they have had a 10-50 or have stated their vehicle is not as fast as the secondary unit


### SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT SOPs

This is a document to outline when any LEO can write a search and seizure on an individual and what rules and laws they must follow.

**Rule 1** - When a warrant is signed it must always be presented to the individual(s) before conducting the raid. Even if they or a lawyer disagree with the warrant it can not be stopped and they fight in court later. Note ‘No Knock’ raids are not allowed unless under rare circumstances like finding a suspect in his/her property. 

**Rule 2** - When inside a property before you touch and move anything, you must take pictures of everything you see. After the raid the lead officer must write up an inventory check on what was seized.

**Rule 3 **- If a warrants scope is based upon stolen officer equipment and in the raid you find illegal amounts of drugs as well as PD equipment the individual can only be charged with the stolen PD equipment and any other charges must be taken to the DA to press onto the individual. 

**Rule 4** - When formatting a warrant, evidence is key. Always use pictures and bodycam footage to build up the warrant. However if a warrant is based on officer testimony there must be at least 2 eyewitness accounts unless it's related to stolen PD equipment where 1 officer report of events is enough. \


**Rule 5** - When searching a property of someone in prison on HUT they must be shown a warrant first but they do not need to be brought on the raid like other suspects are when conducting a search and seizure.  \



##### In and out of an owned property with a Class 2 firearm

If Officers witness, at any time on duty, a suspect with Class 2 firearm enters his/her property, becomes enough probable cause for a Search and Seizure warrant. Photo evidence is required to obtain a warrant through this avenue.


##### In and out of an owned property to distribute illegal Narcotics

If Officers witness, at any time on duty, a suspect involved in selling illegal Narcotics, then entering his/her property to take or store any Narcotics, this becomes enough probable cause for a Search and Seizure warrant. An officer does not have probable cause if the suspect has no indication of distribution within the moments leading up to entering the property. Evidence is always key, make sure to get pictures of the location, Possible Drug call or Suspicious Activity call alert, and suspect going in and out of the property.


##### Missing evidence items used in a crime

If Officers are arresting an individual for a crime that involves shooting or stabbing, where the weapon is key evidence and the suspect is arrested but the weapon is not found on the suspect or located at the scene, this is enough probable cause for a Search and Seizure warrant. Before going through, the scene should be thoroughly searched for the weapon and a logical block radius should be searched. Evidence is always key, make sure to get pictures of the location, the details of the weapon missing including casings, serial number if possible. Note that warrants encompasses the owned properties of the suspect. \



##### Stolen PD Equipment raid

Anybody involved in a robbery, **clearly identified** by CCTV, body cam, pictures, Officer witnesses, and witness statements is enough probable cause for a Search and Seizure of the individuals properties, and vehicles. Anybody found with PD equipment is liable for a raid of all properties, and vehicles. The following equipment falls under these guidelines:



* Police weaponry, such as pistols, tasers, and assault rifles
* Police-grade Armor
* Field Test Kits
* Access Tool \



##### Continued pattern of Sale of Drugs and possession over a 14 day period

Anybody involved in a continued pattern of Sale of Drugs and continuing a pattern of possession charges, are liable for a Search and Seizure warrant of both properties and vehicles, due to the scope of the individuals having easy access to illegal Narcotics. Possession charges numbering 7 or more in a 14 day period. Sale charges of 5 or more in a 14 day period. Evidence is always key, make sure to note down and take a picture of the report file numbers of the possession charges. \



##### Drug trafficking raid

Anybody charged with Drug Trafficking is liable to a Search and Seizure of all properties and vehicles due to the case of Drug Trafficking, and having easy access to illegal Narcotics. Evidence is always key, make sure to note down and take a picture of the report file number for the Drug Trafficking charge. \



##### Continued pattern of Sale of Guns over a 14 day period

Anybody involved in a continued pattern of Sale of Guns and continuing a pattern of possession firearms, are liable for a Search and Seizure warrant of both properties and vehicles, due to the scope of the individuals having easy access to illegal firearms. If caught with 6 or more illegal firearms it is classified as Gun Trafficking. Illegal firearms include unmarked guns. To obtain this warrant, evidence presented must show 3 or more gun sale charges or 5 or more possession of illegal firearm charges. Evidence is always key, make sure to note down and take a picture of the report file numbers of the possession charges. Also make sure to have the casings and serial numbers if possible. 


##### Gun trafficking 

Anybody involved in the Sale of Illegal firearms and possess 6 or more illegal firearms, are liable for a Search and Seizure warrant of both properties and vehicles, due to the scope of the individuals having easy access to illegal firearms. Evidence is always key, make sure to have the casings and serial numbers if possible. Make sure to note down and take a picture of the report file numbers of the possession charges.


### INVESTIGATION SOPs

Criminal Investigations are a shared responsibility. It is the responsibility of the senior-most officer on duty at the time of an incident to delegate and compile evidence among any subordinates chosen to help with an investigation.


#####  \
Chain of Command

The senior-most officer on duty at the time of the scene that opens an investigation is the officer in charge of the case unless one of the following occurs:



* The officer chooses to hand the case off to another officer
* The case is opened by an officer who presents a member of command reasonable evidence to open a case
* The senior-most officer is unable to perform the duties necessary to head the case

Note that the officer placed in charge is granted the ability to delegate responsibilities among other officers during the course of the investigation, however they will also be the responsible party for all legal necessities, including, but not limited to, submitting warrants, compiling all forms of evidence into the case file, and presenting the case to any judicial entities if/when the case goes to court.


##### Evidence

All evidence needs to be noted in the case file with notes regarding the following:



* Where the evidence was collected
* When the evidence was collected
* Any tests or proofs the evidence provides (i.e. Positive fingerprint ID, blood type, etc.)


#####  \
Witness Accounts

Witness accounts are a form of evidence that will need to be typed up and submitted. These accounts will need to be submitted in the form of the following:



* Video evidence of the interview
* Audio evidence of the interview
* Signed statement from the witness, which can be submitted to court anonymously

In addition to the above, witness accounts must be submitted with the date of collection. \
 \



##### Case File

All evidence needs to be noted in the case file with notes regarding evidence numbers if the evidence is not attached to the file. In the case that legal forms must be submitted, such as a warrant, copies must be placed within the file upon submission. The officer in charge of the case will ensure that all information in the file is relevant to the case and present updates to Command with breakthroughs, as well as additional suspects. \
 \



### SPECIALITY SOPs


##### High Speed Pursuit Unit

The High Speed Pursuit unit is a division of highly trained drivers that are trusted to drive and lead in high powered vehicles in pursuits. 



* HSPU Certified drivers will have access to two high speed pursuit vehicles available for purchase and can be used when necessary.
* Interested parties can obtain this certification once they become an Officer.
* The certification will only be offered to individuals with immense interest in the High Speed Pursuit Unit, as well as the ability to drive under pressure and with good coordination on the road. 
* A completion and mastery of three courses is required before an Officer gains the certification.

HSP units will be used in active 10-80s at high speeds. Unless told otherwise by a command member, they should take primary in the pursuit when necessary.  If a HS unit is needed to take primary in a pursuit, permission to overtake should always be requested.

There is a limit of two HSP units allowed in the field at a time.

**_Current fleet vehicles for HSP include:_**

	Inventero Coquette

	Vapid Dominator GTX

	Bravado Gauntlet

**_When can HSP units be deployed:_**

Unlike other ground vehicles, these units are not to be taken out on regular patrols around the state. 

 \
**_Situations where a unit can be deployed include:_**



* High Speed Pursuits including dangerous driving and speeds of over 110 mph
* Street Races that are being set up or are in progress
* Any 10-80 where multiple suspect cars are present
* Large scale robberies (Fleeca+)
* Hostage Situations where a vehicular getaway is possible.


##### Air, Land, and Sea Unit \


The ALS Unit is a division of highly trained officers that have been trusted with handling state of the art police helicopters and boats during pursuits and on normal patrols. 


#### Air

The unit has the ability to provide effective airborne surveillance and give support to the police units on the ground, whether this is with maintaining contact during a high speed chase or keeping track of suspects as they flee on foot through rough terrain. Air support can also be used to help as a means of search and rescue when necessary, though this is not our primary mission. Troopers and upward will be considered for the position however these certifications are not to be given out lightly and require mastery of both fields of support. 

**_When the helicopter can be deployed:_ \
**There is no specific incident that is required for the helicopter to be deployed however it must be a situation where responding via Air Support is necessary and actually needed. The helicopter is not a toy and should only be deployed when absolutely necessary. This includes situations such as:



* High speed pursuits that are causing a danger the the public,
* Larger scale robberies (Fleeca+)
* Pursuits with multiple vehicles/occupants. (Use to catch plates etc.)
* Hostage situations where an eye from the sky may be of help. 

**_Who can use the Air Support:_ \
**Anyone that has the appropriate certs, and Captain+ has the ability to pilot the helicopters as necessary. The Co-Pilot seat can be taken by anyone above the rank of Cadet however they must be fit and ready and have adequate knowledge of the city and they will preferably have prior experience using the high tech cameras on board.

**_Uniform Whilst Flying:_ \
**There is no specific uniform that pilots must wear outside of normal uniform due to the lower altitudes and slower speeds that we fly at; however it is recommended to wear ear protection whilst on board due to the 80+ decibels coming from the helicopter as it flies. \


**_Altitude:_**

Helicopters must always be kept at a safe and reasonable altitude whilst in flight. This means that we never want to see a helicopter flying through the city narrowly avoiding every building that they fly over.

Another reason to fly at higher altitudes is the ability to remain hidden. Flying high means you can often follow suspects without them even knowing, resulting in a successful capture.  

**_Current fleet vehicles for ALS Air include:_** \
	Buckingham Conada

	Buckingham Maverick


#### Water

Officers certified in Air, Land, and Sea (ALS) have access to the "Marine One" boat down at the pier, with this in mind all officers are expected to treat the boat as they would their service vehicle on land. This requires all units to maintain safe travel in and out of ports/docks.

The Marine One boat is not to be "Beached" at any stage unless in a very dangerous pursuit that would put an officer's or a member of the public's life at risk.

In the event that an individual jumps into the water, an officer is fully authorized to jump in after and to perform a “Beat Down” with their fist, due to the severity of this situation the individual is attempting to escape from the police they may become dangerous and brandish a blade in the water, there for the officer is to be extra cautious of this before jumping into the water.

**_Current fleet vehicles for ALS Sea include:_** \
	Nagasaki Dinghy


##### Motorbike Unit

Motorbike certifications will be earned through the completion and mastery of three courses. This certification opens up at Snr Officer for interested parties. Below are the SOPs you must follow while patrolling on a bike:



* There must be at least TWO patrol units active before a motorcycle can be brought out, and there should be a maximum of two motorcycles out at one time.
* If there is more than one motorcycle on patrol, they must be patrolling together when possible.
* The correct uniform should be worn at all times while riding the motorcycle, this includes a High Visibility jacket, a pair of gloves, and a full motorcycle helmet.
* Wheelies on the motorcycle are inexcusable and will result in a permanent suspension from motorcycle patrols, this punishment is non-negotiable.
* During 10-80s, the motorcycle should be the primary unit when in pursuit of motorcycles. If a patrol vehicle stands a better chance of catching up to the vehicle, you are to let them pass at the next safest opportunity.
* If tactical contact is authorized in a 10-80, motorcycle units should withdraw from the primary position and allow a patrol vehicle to carry out the maneuver. Any motorcycle caught attempting to make contact with a vehicle will be suspended from service under the discretion of the commanding officer.

**_Current fleet vehicles for MRU include:_** \
	Nagasaki Shinobi


### USE OF FORCE

The use of force by members of law enforcement is a matter of critical concern both to the public and the law enforcement community. It is recognized that some individuals will not comply with the law or submit to control unless compelled to do so by the use of force; therefore, law enforcement officers are sometimes called upon to use force in the performance of their duties.

The use of the FORCE MATRIX is key and will always be key;

![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")



##### Use of de-escalation techniques

It is the policy of this Department that, whenever feasible, officers shall use techniques and tools consistent with Department de-escalation training to reduce the intensity of any encounter with a suspect and enable an officer to have additional options to mitigate the need to use a higher level of force while maintaining control of the situation.


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Verbal Warnings</span>**

Where feasible, a peace officer shall, prior to the use of any force, make reasonable efforts to identify themselves as a peace officer and to warn that force may be used, unless the officer has objectively reasonable grounds to believe that the person is aware of those facts.


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Proportionality</span>**

Officers may only use a level of force that they reasonably believe is proportional to the seriousness of the suspected offense or the reasonably perceived level of actual or threatened resistance.


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fair and Unbiased Policing</span>**

Officers shall carry out their duties, including use of force, in a manner that is fair and unbiased. Discriminatory conduct on the basis of race, religion, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, housing status, or disability while performing any law enforcement activity is prohibited.


##### Deadly and non-deadly use of force


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Non-deadly use of force</span>**

It is the policy of this Department that personnel may use only that force which is "**_objectively reasonable_**" to:



* DEFEND THEMSELVES
* DEFEND OTHERS
* EFFECT AN ARREST OR DETENTION
* PREVENT ESCAPE
* OVERCOME RESISTANCE


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Drawing or Exhibiting firearms</span>**

Unnecessarily or prematurely drawing or exhibiting a firearm limits an officer's alternatives in controlling a situation, creates unnecessary anxiety on the part of citizens, and may result in an unwarranted or accidental discharge of the firearm. Officers shall not draw or exhibit a firearm unless the circumstances surrounding the incident create a reasonable belief that it may be necessary to use the firearm. When an officer has determined that the use of deadly force is not necessary, the officer shall, as soon as practicable, secure or holster the firearm. Any drawing and exhibiting of a firearm shall conform with this policy on the use of firearms. Moreover, any intentional pointing of a firearm at a person by an officer shall be reported.


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deadly use of force</span>**

It is the policy of this Department that officers shall use deadly force upon another person only when the officer reasonably believes, based on the totality of circumstances, that such force is necessary for either of the following reasons:



* _TO DEFEND AGAINST AN IMMINENT THREAT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY TO THE OFFICER OR CIVILIAN_
* _TO APPREHEND A FLEEING PERSON FOR ANY FELONY THAT THREATENED OR RESULTED IN DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURIES, IF THE OFFICE REASONABLY BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON WILL CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY TO ANOTHER UNLESS IMMEDIATELY APPREHENDED._

In determining whether deadly force is necessary, officers shall evaluate each situation in light of the particular circumstances of each case and shall use other available resources and techniques if reasonably safe and feasible. Before discharging a firearm, officers shall consider their surroundings and potential risks to bystanders to the extent reasonable under the circumstances.


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rendering Aid</span>**

After any use of force, officers shall promptly provide basic and emergency medical assistance to all members of the community, including victims, witnesses, subjects, suspects, persons in custody, subjects of a use of force and fellow officers:



* To the extent of the officer's training and experience in first aid/CPR/AED; and
* To the level of equipment available to an officer at the time assistance is needed.


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Warning Shots</span>**

It is the policy of this Department that warning shots shall only be used in exceptional circumstances where it might reasonably be expected to avoid the need to use deadly force. Generally, warning shots shall be directed in a manner that minimizes the risk of injury to innocent persons, ricochet dangers and property damage.


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Shooting at or from moving vehicles</span>**

It is the policy of this Department that firearms shall not be discharged at a moving vehicle unless a person in the vehicle is immediately threatening the officer or another person with deadly force by means other than the vehicle. The moving vehicle itself shall not presumptively constitute a threat that justifies an officer's use of deadly force. An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall move out of its path instead of discharging a firearm at it or any of its occupants. Firearms shall not be discharged from a moving vehicle, except in exigent circumstances and consistent with this policy regarding the use of Deadly Force.


### STRIKE POLICY

If any officer, regardless of department/rank/division is expected to withhold all policies and conduct when on duty. If there are any breaches/reports made about an officer, the departments have the right to open an investigation into said officer. 

Any sort of misconduct or negligence reported to superiors can result in strike points on your badge, which are distributed in terms of the seriousness of the misconduct and if it is a repeat offense. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Strike Tiers</span>**

Each officer  will start with 0 strikes to their name, with any investigation into the officer may warrant a strike. Investigations such as Misuse of Police Equipment such as; Weaponry, Vehicles, Badge. 


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Strike 1</span>**

 Verbal Warning (2+ Strike Points) - This will see you spending some time riding along with a Supervisor until they see fit that you can patrol solo.


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Strike 2</span>**

Foot/bike Patrol/Radar Duty (5+ Strike Points) - This will see you either doing foot/bike patrols or running radar on set roads by your supervisor, until deemed necessary. 


###### **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Strike 3</span>**
